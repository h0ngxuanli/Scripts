## Why and How transfer learning can learn?
The main idea behind transfer learning is enhancing inter-domain transferability and intra-domain discriminability. $\textit{Ben-Davidâ€™s Theorem}$ demystifies transfer learning and fascinates me greatly. I wrote [survey of UDA.pdf](https://github.com/k0ngyiji/Scripts/blob/master/survey%20of%20UDA.pdf) as a brief summary for my research experience on Unsupervised Domain Adaptation.


## Multi-source domain adaptation
During my research on traditional unsupervised domain adaptation,  I  [survey of UDA.pdf](https://github.com/k0ngyiji/Scripts/blob/master/multi-source%20domain%20adaptation.pdf) reformulate it into QP form.




## Transformer and Graph Neural Networks
I have met a lot of Transformer models during intern and [VectorNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04259) is the most elegant and inspiring work among them. I wrote [self-attention and GCN.pdf](https://github.com/k0ngyiji/Scripts/blob/master/self-attention%20and%20GCN.pdf) for a group meeting on how to model interactions between traffic agents.
