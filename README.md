## Why and How transfer learning can learn?
The main idea behind transfer learning is enhancing inter-domain transferability and intra-domain discriminability. $\textit{Ben-David’s Theorem}$ demystifies transfer learning and fascinates me greatly. I wrote [survey of UDA.pdf](https://github.com/k0ngyiji/Scripts/blob/master/survey%20of%20UDA.pdf) as a brief summary for my research experience on Unsupervised Domain Adaptation.
